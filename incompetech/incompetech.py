"""incompetech's catalogue: the lookup tables, and the normaliser over them.

Kevin MacLeod publishes the whole catalogue as one JSON file — 1400-odd
pieces, one request, no key — which is why nothing here crawls anything. What
that file does *not* carry is what its own numbers mean: `genre` and
`collection` are bare ids whose tables live only as inline JavaScript in the
catalogue page. They are transcribed below, and this module is the one place
in the repo that holds them.

The raw rows are thin and dirty, and every one of these is real:

  * `genre` is a numeric id; `collection` is a numeric **code**, which is *not*
    the collection's `id` — see `COLLECTIONS`.
  * `length` is "hh:mm:ss", and "00:00:00" on three rows means "unknown";
    `bpm` is a string, sometimes null and 238 times "0", which likewise means
    "not measured" rather than a tempo. Both become NULL — see `parse_bpm`.
  * `instruments` and `feel` are comma-separated free text, with the same
    instrument spelled "Piano" and "PIano".
  * `\r\n` runs appear inside title, instruments and description, 505 rows
    carry leading or trailing whitespace, and a few `video` and `itunes`
    values begin with a space *before* the URL.
  * `null` and `""` are both used for absent, inconsistently per field.
  * `feel` has a 20-word vocabulary that one piece ignores.
  * `uuid` repeats twice and comes in four shapes (a real UUID, an ISRC, a
    bare number, a truncated fragment); `isrc` repeats six times, twice on
    pieces that are not the same music. `filename` is the only unique field.
  * `wav` holds no WAV: 160 of its 268 values point at a Downloads page that
    404s and the rest at a filmmusic.io page that has moved. It is kept
    verbatim as `wav_link` and is not an audio URL.

`normalize_piece` deals with all of it and returns a `Piece`; `catalog.py`
stores those in SQLite. Nothing here reads the environment, writes a file or
imports Flask: the layering is one-way, `web` → this package.

Everything in the catalogue is CC BY 4.0 to Kevin MacLeod. The credit is a
licence condition rather than a courtesy, so `credit_line` lives here and
every row that leaves the database carries one.
