"""The incompetech catalogue as a SQLite database you can actually filter.

The catalogue page can search one substring over title, instruments and
description and AND a set of feels. It cannot ask for a tempo, a duration, a
collection, a category or an upload date, which are exactly the questions
worth asking when you are looking for a piece to put under something. So the
catalogue is normalised into SQLite once and queried locally after that.

    python -m incompetech build
    python -m incompetech query --feel Dark --feel Mysterious \
        --bpm-max 90 --min-length 3:00

The shape is ordinary: one row per piece keyed by `filename` (the only field
in the catalogue that is unique — see `incompetech.py`), `genre` and
`collection` as lookup tables, and `instrument` and `feel` as many-to-many
relations, because "pieces with a choir and no drums" is a join and not a
substring search. `piece_fts` is an FTS5 index over title and description
where the interpreter has FTS5, and a LIKE scan where it does not.

The database is a **build artefact**: one command rebuilds it (two requests —
the catalogue JSON, and the page whose lookup tables it is checked against), so
it is gitignored rather than committed. `build_file` writes it beside the
target and `os.replace`s it into place, so a rebuild under the running web app
swaps the file in one step and never leaves a half-built database where a
request can open it.

Nothing here imports Flask, and nothing here knows there is a web layer: the
layering is one-way, `web` → this package.

Everything in the catalogue is CC BY 4.0 to Kevin MacLeod. `meta` carries the
licence, the attribution and the credit sentence, and every row `search`
returns has a finished `credit` on it, so a row that leaves this database
takes its obligation with it.
